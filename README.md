The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the world by killing millions of people. The goal of this project is to utilize advanced machine learning models to analyze the global COVID-19 data 
and predict the future patterns of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 data were downloaded from John Hopkins University and Worldometer between January 23, 2020, and April 26, 2021. 
Advanced machine learning techniques including polynomial regression, support vector regression, and Holt's double exponential smoothing were developed to predict the daily cases 
for three countries: the USA, India, and Brazil. Based on our experimental results, the USA and Brazil were predicted to decline in the total number of daily cases. However, 
the daily COVID-19 cases in India were predicted to increases as a new variant of the virus was massively spreading throughout the country. In conclusion, advanced machine learning 
techniques were efficient and effective to analyze and predict the global COVID-19 data.  Our models show good prediction results for all three countries. 
Brazil and the USA were expected to decline in daily COVID-19 cases as more vaccines become available to their residence. However, India was predicted to increase in daily COVID-19 cases.
